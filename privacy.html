        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Effective date: March 20, 2024</p>

        <p>
          SolCrys AI, Inc. ("SolCrys," "we," "our," or "us") provides enterprise AI products and services to organizations in the United States.
          This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect personal information when operating our websites, products, and services (collectively, the "Services").
        </p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We collect information in three primary ways:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Account & Contact Information.</strong> Names, work email addresses, phone numbers, job roles, and company details provided when you request a demo, create an account, or interact with us.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Service Usage Data.</strong> Activity logs, configuration settings, workflow metadata, and content processed through SolCrys copilots, including prompts, outputs, and approvals.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Support & Feedback.</strong> Information you submit via support tickets, surveys, usability sessions, or interviews.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you connect SolCrys to third-party systems (e.g., Salesforce, Slack, Snowflake), we process the data necessary to provide the integration, subject to your configuration. We do not use customer-provided data to train foundation models.
        </p>

        <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
        <p>We use personal information to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Provide, maintain, and improve the Services and underlying infrastructure.</li>
          <li>Configure and tailor AI copilots to your workflows.</li>
          <li>Respond to requests, provide technical support, and communicate about service updates.</li>
          <li>Monitor performance, detect fraudulent or malicious activity, and ensure compliance with laws and policies.</li>
          <li>Meet contractual obligations and enforce agreements, including our Terms of Use.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Legal Bases for Processing</h2>
        <p>
          Where required by law, we rely on legitimate interests to operate and secure the Services, fulfill contracts when providing solutions to customers, and obtain consent for optional communications.
        </p>

        <h2>4. How We Share Information</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Service Providers.</strong> Trusted vendors that support hosting, communications, analytics, and security, under written agreements limiting their use of data to the contracted services.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Enterprise Customers.</strong> Organizations that license SolCrys receive analytics and logs related to their employees' use of the Services.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Legal & Safety.</strong> We may disclose information to comply with applicable law, respond to lawful requests, or protect the rights, property, or safety of SolCrys, our customers, or others.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Business Transactions.</strong> If SolCrys is involved in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction, subject to this Policy.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
        <p>
          We maintain administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect information against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. These measures include encryption in transit and at rest, network segmentation, role-based access controls, and routine penetration testing.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>
          We retain personal information for as long as necessary to deliver the Services, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. Customers may configure retention periods for certain categories of content inside the SolCrys platform.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Your Choices & Rights</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Opt out of marketing communications by using the unsubscribe link or emailing <a href="mailto:privacy@solcrys.ai">privacy@solcrys.ai</a>.</li>
          <li>Request access, correction, or deletion of your personal information via the same email address or through your SolCrys administrator.</li>
